## What is HiPerGator?

[HiPerGator (HPG)](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/services/hipergator/) is UF's supercomputer
(a cluster of computers).
Since HPG is used by many research groups at UF,
it is _vital_ that HPG must share its resources intelligently.

### Get access to HPG

1. [Request an account](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/access/account-request/).
   - If you are part of the UF HEP group, request `group=avery`.

  <!-- Prof. Paul Avery was instrumental in setting up UF's HEP computing resources.
   Email Prof. Avery (`avery@phys.ufl.edu`) explaining who you are and why you seek his computing resources.
   If he gives you permission, then fill out a
   [UFRC service request](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/help/support-requests/)
   and forward Avery's permission email.
   Once approved, you'll be able to submit SLURM scripts to the UFRC computer cluster! -->

1. Log onto a HPG **login node** by typing this into your local terminal:

   ```bash
   ssh your_gatorlink_UN@gator.rc.ufl.edu
   # Use your GatorLink username and password.
   # Do the 2-factor authentication process.
   ```

   - If this command fails then UFRC may not have approved your account yet.

**Congrats! You are now working on HiPerGator!**

Do the command `pwd` to check that you are in your home area:

```bash
/home/your_gatorlink_UN/
```

#### Notes on your home area

- Do not store big files here as you are only given **40 GB of storage**.
- Do not run intensive code here. To execute big jobs, [submit a SLURM script](#how-to-submit-slurm-scripts).
- This area has only one server (node) hosting it.

### What resources do you have?

Play with these commands to learn about your account's resources:

```bash
id                 # Print info about your group.
slurmInfo          # Print your primary group's SLURM info.
slurmInfo <group>  # Print <group>'s SLURM info.

# Memory/space allocation:
home_quota     # See how much space you take up on /home/<your_UN>/.

ssh login3            # Jump to login node 3. There are nodes 1-4.
showAssoc <username>  # See what groups are associated with <username>.
```

### Explore your other workspaces

You have two bigger workspaces.
To access them, do:

```bash
# Big workspace 1:
cd /blue/your_group/your_gatorlink_UN/
# Big workspace 2:
cd /orange/your_group/your_gatorlink_UN/
# NOTE: tab-completion won't work until you manually `cd` here first.

# Learn about your space allocation in these areas:
blue_quota     # See how much space your group uses on /blue/.
blue_quota -u  # See how much space you take up on /blue/.
orange_quota   # See how much space your group uses on /orange/.
```

#### Notes about your big workspaces

- This area has access to 51,000 cores.
- `/blue/` has a total storage of 8 PB.
- `/orange/` has a total storage of 6 PB.

### Getting around 2-factor authentication

Thanks to Matthew and Neha for recommending [these instructions](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/SSH_Multiplexing).

## How to install software on HPG

To install a package, first try: `module load <package>`

```bash
# Examples
module load python3
# As a shorthand you can do: `ml python3`

# Other useful modules:
ml rootpy
ml pycharm
ml tensorflow
ml vscode

# Check all available modules:
ml spider
# Use `F` to move forward a page. `B` to move back.

# Look for only modules with 'py' in name.
ml spider py

# Look for all modules that deal with Python:
ml key python

# Useful `ml` commands:
ml list                      # List your currently loaded modules.
ml purge                     # Unload all modules.
module unload python3        # Unload the python3 module.
ml intel                     # Allows you to do `make` commands.
ml intel/2018 openmpi/3.1.0  # Compiles stuff?
```

## SLURM

Submit your long computational jobs to HPG's computer cluster:
**SLURM**
(**S**imple **L**inux **U**tility for **R**esource **M**anagement)

- SLURM has access to 51,000 cores!

### How to submit SLURM scripts

1. Make a **SLURM script** which contains the instructions for your job.

   - Copy and paste the code below into a file called `myslurmscript.sbatch`.
     - Be sure to use your own values for `--account` and `--mail-user`!

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   #SBATCH --job-name=myjob             # Job name.
   #SBATCH --output=myjob_output.log    # Output file name. NOTE: %j=jobID
   #SBATCH --error=myjob_error.log      # Error file name.
   #SBATCH --mem=32mb                   # RAM request on a node. Default is 2gb.
   #SBATCH --time=2:00:00               # Time limit (hh:mm:ss).
   #SBATCH --account=YOUR_GROUP_HERE    # Use resources from this account.
   #SBATCH --mail-user=YOUR_EMAIL_HERE  # Get emailed the job status.
   #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL              # Job status options: BEGIN, END, ALL, FAIL, NONE

   # Put the code you want to run below:
   pwd; hostname; date

   module load python3

   echo "Running my python script."

   python3 /home/your_gatorlink_UN/helloworld.py
   ```

1. Make a Python script called `helloworld.py` which contains:

   ```python
   print("Hello World")
   ```

   - Store this file at `/home/your_gatorlink_UN/helloworld.py`
  
1. Submit your SLURM script to the SLURM scheduler:

   ```bash
   sbatch myslurmscript.sbatch
   ```

1. Check that your job was submitted:

   `squeue -u your_gatorlink_UN`

   - This also prints out the `job_id`.
   - **NOTE:** If you don't see any jobs running it may have finished already.

   <!-- | Effect | Command |
   | --- | --- |
   | Check your SLURM jobs (also prints your job_id) | `squeue  -u <your_UN>` |
   | Cancel your job | `scancel <job_id>` | -->

1. Check your email for details about the job
(SLURM will email you if you supplied the `--mail-user` flag).

#### Check the status of your SLURM jobs

Use the `squeue` command:

```bash
squeue --me        # Display your job info.
squeue -u rosedj1  # Display job info for user 'rosedj1'.

# Format job output.
squeue --me -o "%j"  # Display all job names.
squeue --me -o "%.18i %.9P %.8j %.8u %.2t %.10M %.6D %R"  # Default display.
```

- Check out all `squeue` options [here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/squeue.html).

#### Notes on SLURM jobs

- [More SLURM script options](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Annotated_SLURM_Script).
- SLURM scripts typically use the extension `.sbatch`.
- *Anything* you run locally can be run on SLURM.
- SLURM puts you in a clean shell (none of your aliases will be available).
  - To make your usual shell stuff available, put this in your SLURM script:

     ```bash
     source ~/.bash_profile
     ```

- SLURM executes your code starting from the directory
where you submitted the SLURM script. So if you do:
    sbatch `/home/your_UN/work/myscript.sbatch`, then SLURM will execute your code at: `/home/your_UN/work/`
- The "shebang" (`#!`) at the top of the SLURM script can invoke whatever
interpreter you want:

    ```bash
    #!/usr/bin/env python3
    ```

- Example SLURM scripts are located at: `/blue/data/training/SLURM/`
  - To learn about single jobs, look at: `single_job.sh`
  - To learn about parallel jobs, look at: `parallel_job.sh`

### SLURM directives using #SBATCH

```bash
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=600mb    # Memory (RAM) per core/processor/CPU.

#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=1         # Number of MPI tasks (processes). Ex: ntasks=1, runs on 1 CPU.
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4

# Time: Can also use: -t=00:01:00
```

Pass in Bash variables into your SLURM script:

```bash
sbatch --export=A=5,b='test' my_script.sbatch
```

## Development Sessions

Before you submit a SLURM script,
use an **interactive development session** to test your code first.

*When should I use a dev session?*

- When your code takes longer than 10 minutes (wall time).
- When you need more than 64 GB of RAM.
- When you need more than 16 cores.

**NOTE:** HPG has 6 dev nodes.

### How to start a SLURM interactive session on a compute node

```bash
srun --partition=hpg-dev --mem=4gb --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=8 --time=04:00:00 --pty bash -i 
```

N.B. `srundev` is an alias for `srun --partition=hpg2-dev --pty bash -i`, so the above simplfies to:

```bash
module load ufrc  # Make the srundev command available.
srundev --mem=4gb --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=8 --time=04:00:00

# Another example:
srun -p bigmem --mem=400gb --time=16:00:00 --qos=avery-b --pty bash -i
```

Useful options:

```bash
srundev -h             # help!
srundev --time=04:00:  # begin a 4 hr dev session, with the default 1 processor core and 2 GB of memory
srundev -t 3-0 # session lasts 3 days
srundev -t 60  # session lasts 60 min
# default time is 00:10:00 (10 min) and max time is 12:00:00
# Specify which partition you want to run on - like a dev node:
--partition=hpg2-dev  # Can also choose `bigmem` for large memory tasks.
-p bigmem  # Either the process name or shortcut for --partition.
```

/ufrc/ is a **parallel file system**

- CAN handle 51000 cores, reading and writing to it
- 2 TB limit per group

_I'm taking a computing course: how do I use my course's resources instead of my research group's?_

```bash
# If you are taking PHZ 5155 for example:
module load class/phz5155
# Each time you want to submit a SLURM job, do that command.
```

View resource limits for a particular QOS:
`showQos <qos>`

- Find your <qos> options by doing `showAssoc`
- Example: `showQos avery`
- As of Pi Day 2020, this account has 100 CPU cores, 360 GB of RAM, and no GPUs.
- Even more impressively, avery burst qos has 9x these resources! I.e. 3.24 TB of RAM!!!

***Install Python packages into your user area***

```bash
ml python3  # Doing this makes the `pip` command available.
pip install --user <new_package>
# Example: pip install --user vaex
```

## SLURM sbatch directives

They start with `#SBATCH` and then have some kind of flag, like `--time=`.

```bash
# Multi-letter directives are double dashes:
--nodes=1  # Number of processors.
--ntasks
--ntasks-per-node
--ntasks-per-socket
--cpus-per-task (cores per task)
# Memory usage:
--mem=1gb  # Alternatively can do: --mem-per-cpu=500mb
--distribution

# --Long-option    -short-option    description
--nodes=1          -N               request num of servers
--ntasks=1         -n               num tasks that job will use (useful for MPI applications)
--cpus-per-task=8  -c

#SBATCH --qos=YOUR_GROUP_HERE        # Specify the QOS (quality of service).

```

### QOS or burstQOS

"Quality of Service" allows **9x allocation of resources** when resources are idle.
Trigger this "burst capacity" by changing (for example) `avery` to `avery-b`:

```bash
#SBATCH --qos=avery-b
```

- So if you invest in 10 cores, burst `qos` can use up to 90 cores!

### Task Arrays

```bash
#SBATCH --array=1-200%10  # run on 10 jobs at a time to be nice
$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
%A: job id
%a: task id
```

## Use Jupyter Notebooks on HPG

Two main ways to use Jupyter NB on HPG:

### Option 1

Use HPG's robust and built-in
[Jupyter NB GUI](https://jhub.rc.ufl.edu/).

### Option 2

Run a SLURM script to start a NB. Reliable and fast.

1. Log into HPG.
1. (You only need to do this step if you have never done it before.)
If you're not sure, then do this step anyway:

   ```bash
   module load jupyter
   jupyter-notebook password
   # When it prompts you for a password, put anything or leave it blank.
   ```

1. Make a new file on HPG (call it `remote_jupynb.sbatch`) and put these contents inside:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   #SBATCH --job-name=jupyter
   #SBATCH --output=jupyter_notebook.log
   #SBATCH --ntasks=1
   #SBATCH --mem=400mb
   #SBATCH --time=04:00:00
   date;hostname;pwd

   module add jupyter

   launch_jupyter_notebook

   # This script was taken from: https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Remote_Jupyter_Notebook#SLURM_Job
   ```

1. In your HPG terminal do: `sbatch practice.sbatch`
1. Then `cat` the log file (`jupyter_notebook.log`) produced in your area.
1. Copy the line that starts with `ssh` and execute that command in a new local terminal (not HPG terminal).
1. Copy the line that looks like `http://localhost:23775` and paste it into your browser.

#### Possible Errors

- "Resource allocation error" or something similar: This most likely means that your group doesn't have the necessary resources to submit SLURM scripts. How to check it:
  - In your HPC terminal: `id`. This will show your group.
  kindly ask this person to put $1,000,000 towards HPG resources, because science.
  - For more debugging, go to: https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/Remote_Jupyter_Notebook

#### Notes

- Log into a specific SLURM node: `ssh -NL 26686:c25a-s26.ufhpc:26686 your_gatorlink@gator.rc.ufl.edu`
- I can only `import ROOT` on a Python2 kernel, not Python3.
- I cannot get feather to work on HPG or IHEPA computers.
- The name Jupyter is a combination of other coding languages: Julia + Python + R
  - Although Jupyter notebooks can accommodate R, users prefer R studio.
- Matt Gitzendanner's JupyNB tutorial: `/blue/data/training/Jupyter/Training_demo.ipynb`

QUESTIONS:
[X] I can't reconnect to my screen command because each time I log into the cluster I attach to a different node
- Reattach to: ssh login1
- `hostname` to get host info
[X] Do I have to run sbatch script.sbatch or can I just do ./script.sbatch
- ALWAYS do `sbatch`. This will use the cluster's resources instead of /ufrc/'s (a filesystem) resources. 
[X] After I do cmsenv, I can't run a Python3 kernel.
- I can! Lovely.
[X] You say up above it runs 100K loops but I think it's just 10K loops. 
- It's smart and changes depending on the code!
[X] pandas 
- save files as hdf, as it is native to most systems
- These have trouble working: parquet, pickle, feather
[X] Diff between R and Python?
- R is for statistics!
- R is pure!
- Python has many modules, some of which may be incompatible with others.

## HPG COMMANDS

See full list [here](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/SLURM_Commands).

```bash
id                  # see your user id, your group id, etc.
sbatch <script.sh>  # submit script.sh to scheduler
sbatch --qos=phz5155-b <script.sh>
squeue             # see ALL jobs running
squeue -u rosedj1  # just see your jobs
squeue -j <job_id>
scancel <job_id>   # kill a job
sacct              # View your jobs and account info.
sstat -j <job_id>  # Get statistics about job <job_id>.
slurmInfo          # Get info about resource utilization (may need `ml ufrc`).
slurmInfo -p       # Partition, a better summary
slurmInfo -g <group_name>	# 
sinfo
srun --mpi=pmix_v2 myApp
```

### GRID Certificates and `voms-proxy-init`

To set VOMS PROXY on HPG:

```bash
# Set up environment for voms-proxy-* commands:
source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/current/el7-x86_64/setup.sh
# Set your env vars:
export X509_CERT_DIR=/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/grid/etc/grid-security/certificates
# Now you should be able to do (for example):
voms-proxy-init --valid=168:00

# These may help you use the `-voms cms` option:
export X509_VOMS_DIR=/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/grid/etc/grid-security/vomsdir
export VOMS_USERCONF=/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/grid/etc/vomses
```

### How to read your GRID certificate while running SLURM jobs

`/cmsuf` is visible from worker nodes where your jobs are running.
So, you need to put the `myproxy` file `/cmsuf`, e.g.,

```bash
voms-proxy-init -out /cmsuf/data/store/user/t2/users/rosedj1/myproxy
```

Then, inside your job script, point it to the proxy:

```bash
export X509_USER_PROXY=/cmsuf/data/store/user/t2/users/rosedj1/myproxy
```

Finally you also need to set this:

```bash
export X509_CERT_DIR=/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/osg-software/osg-wn-client/certificates
```

(Thanks, Bockjoo!)

## How to use CMSSW on HPG

1. Start a dev session
2. `source /cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/cmsset_default.sh`  # this makes cmsrel and cmsenv two new aliases for you!
3. Now cmsrel your favorite `CMSSW_X_Y_Z`.

## Vaex on HPG

```bash
ml python3
pip install --user vaex
# How to convert root files to hdf5 on HPG:
from root_numpy import root2array
import numpy
import vaex
arr = root2array("<file.root>", "<tree>")
np.savetxt("<file.csv>", arr)
vdf = vaex.from_csv("<file.csv>")
vdf.export_hdf5("<file.hdf5>")
# I'm pretty sure this process gets killed though.
```

## Tier 2

HPG can access the UF T2 storage space, which commonly holds CMS root files.
The area is:

- `/cmsuf/data/store/user/<your_UN>/`

You cannot write to this T2 area; only CRAB can!
Simply add this to your CRAB config file:

- `config.Site.storageSite = 'T2_US_Florida'`

### Modify CRAB T2 Area using `uberftp`

1. Go to somewhere like an `lxplus` machine.

1. Activate your proxy:

   - `voms-proxy-init -voms cms -rfc --valid=168:00`

1. Start an interactive `uberftp` session:

   - ```uberftp cmsio.rc.ufl.edu``` <b> This does not work any more as of Aug. 25, 2023. Please use gfal commands, e.g., gfal-ls davs://cmsio2.rc.ufl.edu:1094/store/user </b>

   - Now you can interact directly with the files on the remote system!

1. NOTE:
   - Many typical Linux commands won't work here.
     - To see the available commands, type: `help`.
     - [More details on commands](https://www.mankier.com/1/uberftp).
   - Tab-completion does not work.
   - Wildcards may not work either.
   - Useful `uberftp` commands:
     - `get` (similar to `cp`)
       - **BEWARE!**
       If you don't specify a destination file,
       then the source will be overwritten as an empty file!
     - `rename` (similar to `mv`)

#### Give commands directly to `uberftp`

***BEWARE!*** It is surprisingly easy to overwrite your own files.

```bash
uberftp cmsio.rc.ufl.edu "rm your_file" <b> This does not work any more as of Aug. 25, 2023. Please use gfal commands, e.g., gfal-rm davs://cmsio2.rc.ufl.edu:1094/store/user/_your_lxplus_user_name_/filename instead </b>
```

### Copy files to/from CRAB Tier Area using `gfal-copy`

Syntax: `gfal-copy <src> <dst>`

```bash
# Add 'file://' to the beginning of any local file.
# Add 'gsiftp://' to the beginning of any file on a Tier server.
gfal-copy  file://<local_file>  gsiftp://cmsio.rc.ufl.edu/<remote_file> <b> This does not work any more as of Aug. 25, 2023. Please use gfal commands, e.g., gfal-copy davs://cmsio2.rc.ufl.edu:1094/store/user/_your_lxplus_user_name_/filename ./ instead </b>
# Use -r for recursive copy.
```

### Your Personal T2 Area

You *can* write to your "personal T2 area" which has rather large storage.
Use this area frequently:

- `/cmsuf/data/store/user/t2/users/<your_UN>/`

### How to access HPG T2 files from lxplus

```bash
# Initialize your proxy:
voms-proxy-init -voms cms
# Use a "root redirector":
root -l root://cmsxrootd.fnal.gov//store/user/drosenzw/path/to/file.root
```

## General HPG Info

Data center near Satchel’s where HiPerGator resides
51000 cores in HPG2 cluster
(only 14000 cores in HPG1)
world-class cluster
3 PB of storage

threaded=parallel=open MPI

### Parallelism

HPG can allow your program to be run across multiple threads.
However, the process must run on a single server/computer/node.

- Must use: `--ntasks=1`
- `--cpus-per-task=your_num`

For example, you can use Python's `multiprocessing` package.
In that case, you don't have to set `--ntasks=1`;
you can choose a different number.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=parallel_job_test # Job name
#SBATCH --mail-type=END,FAIL         # Mail events (NONE, BEGIN, END, FAIL, ALL)
#SBATCH --mail-user=email@ufl.edu    # Where to send mail	
#SBATCH --nodes=1                    # Run all processes on a single node	
#SBATCH --ntasks=4                   # Number of processes
#SBATCH --mem=1gb                    # Total memory limit
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00              # Time limit hrs:min:sec
#SBATCH --output=multiprocess_%j.log # Standard output and error log
date;hostname;pwd
module load python/3
python script.py  # This must implement `multiprocessing`.
```

- **Process**: A completely different program. Effectively runs in its own Python interpreter.

You can do parallel applications:

- OpenMP, Threaded, Pthreads applications
- all cores on ONE server, shared memory
- CAN'T talk to other servers
MPI (Message Passing Interface)
- applications which can run across multiple servers

## WARNING: Messy stuff below!

ntasks = # of MPI rinks
say you want to run 100 tasks across 10 nodes
100 MPI ranks
You might think the scheduler would put 10 MPI ranks on each node, 
- but it won't be so equal per node, necessarily!
The scheduler may put 30 tasks on one node, and distribute the remaining 70 tasks on other nodes.
Though you can control the ntasks-per-node
Two processors, each processor has 2 cores
16 cores per processor
64 cores per node

For Windows users who need a Terminal:
- MobaXterm
- or the Linux subsystem
Need an SFTP client to move from to your computer
- Cyberduck
- FileZilla
Text editor:
- BBedit(?)

There are also compute nodes
- this is where the money is! 
- They are optimized to distribute jobs across different computers efficiently

Memory utilization = MAX amount used at one point
Memory request = aim for 20-50% of total use

BE WISE ABOUT USING RESOURCES!

- Users have taken up 16 cores and TOOK MORE TIME than just using 1 core!!!

It would be interesting write a SLURM script which submits
many of the same job with different cores, plots the efficiency vs. num cores

*In the job summary email, the memory usage is talking about RAM efficiency*

Time: 
-t
time limit is 31 days
- It is to our benefit to be accurate with job time
- infinite loops will just waste resources and make you think your job is actually working
- the scheduler might postpone your job if it sees it will delay other people's jobs

Learning about Xpra:
module load gui
launch_gui_session -h	# shows help options
- This will load a session on a graphical node on the cluster
- Default time on server is 4 hrs
- use the -a option to use secondary account
- use the -b option to use burst SLURM qos

Paste the xpra url into your local terminal

Do: 

```bash
module load gui
launch_gui_session -e <executable>	(e.g., launch_rstudio_gui)
xpra attach ssh:<stuff>
xpra_list_sessions
scancel <job_id>
```

What is HPG?
HPG is essentially just a big cluster of computers.
More technically, it is many interconnected servers (compute nodes). 
Each compute node has either 2 or 4 "sockets" and each socket holds around 32 or 64 "CPU cores" (CPUs).
Therefore each node has a limited amount of:
- CPU cores, RAM, memory bandwidth, network bandwidth, and local storage.
Impressively, the entire HPG network has ~200 PB of memory (RAM)!!!

The two main partitions are HPG1 (old) and HPG2 (new):
HPG2 has ~500 computers: 
- 2 servers (nodes) per computer, 32 cores per server, 4 GB RAM/core = 256 GB RAM per HPG2 computer
HPG1 has ~250 computers: 
- 1 server (node) per computer, 64 cores per server, 4 GB RAM/core = 256 GB RAM per HPG1 computer
Actually though, there is only about 3.5 GB RAM/core available for processing!

You can get more info on the compute nodes by doing:
module load ufrc
nodeInfo

By default, your jobs will go to these partitions:
- hpg1-compute and hpg2-compute

If you want to specify a particular partition, do:
--partition=<whichever_partition_you_want>
(A list of partitions can be found by doing `nodeInfo`)

Default job parameters given by the scheduler:
1 CPU core
600 MB of memory (RAM)
10 min time limit
- Of course you can change these using directives (flags)!

Terminology:
8 cpus/task = 8 cores on that one server (compute node?)
1 node has: RAM, maybe 2 sockets (processors), each with 2 cores
Each server (compute node, physical server) has either 2 or 4 sockets.
You can also specify the number of tasks per processor: ntasks-per-socket
each processor only has a certain bandwidth to memory
processor = cpu = core

Entire PHZ5155 course is allocated a whole node!
- This is 32 cores on HPG2
The slowdown of your job may be in the bandwidth!

- `/orange/` and `/blue/` are **parallel file systems**
- A filesystem is effectively a hard drive (used for data storage).
  That's why it's beneficial to submit big jobs to the SLURM computer cluster.
- login1, login2 are individual servers
